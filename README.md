# Have you ever created your own SECRET LANGUAGE?

As a kid I always wanted to make my own language using crazy shapes, new letters,
and obscure sounds.

But I never did it.

Even now it's tough to do.

So instead, I'm creating my own secret code. Using a bit of number theory and
discrete math, I'm using python to create an algorithm that scrambles a ***secret***
message, so you don't have to worry when someone intercepts it.

If you're reading this README right now, I haven't done too much with the project
yet.

But stay tuned because some cool things are coming.

Check out my python code so far above. Or visit my website here for other
math and data projects I've done:
